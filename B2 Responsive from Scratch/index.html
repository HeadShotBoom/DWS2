            <div id="headshot"><img src="images/headshot.jpg" alt="headshot"></div>
            <p>Joe McNally is an internationally acclaimed photographer whose career has spanned 30 years and included assignments in over 50 countries. He has shot cover stories for TIME, Newsweek, Fortune, New York, Entertainment Weekly, The New York Times Sunday Magazine, and Men's Journal. He has been at various times in his career a contract photographer for Sports Illustrated, a staff photographer at LIFE, and currently, an ongoing 23 year contributor to the National Geographic, shooting numerous cover stories for those publications.</p>
            <p>Joe was listed by American Photo as one of the 100 Most Important people in Photography and described by the magazine as "perhaps the most versatile photojournalist working today". He has been honored as a member of Kodak-PDN Legends Online, as well as being a Nikon Legend Behind the Lens. In 2010, he was voted as one of the 30 most influential photographers of the decade in an industry-wide Photo District News survey. McNally won the first Alfred Eisenstaedt Award for Journalist Impact for a LIFE coverage titled "The Panorama of War." He has also been honored numerous times by Communication Arts, PDN, Graphis, American Photo, POY, and The Word Press Photo Foundation.</p>
            <p>In the aftermath of 9/11, McNally, using the world's only life-sized Polaroid camera, created a project called "Faces of Ground Zero," which traveled through 2002, became a book, and helped generate approximately $2 million for the relief effort. It is considered by many museum and art professionals to be one of the most important artist endeavors to evolve from the 9/11 tragedy. His fine art work is represented by Monroe Gallery of Santa Fe, and his prints are in numerous collections, most significantly the National Portrait Gallery of the United States.</p>
            <p>He shot the first all-digital coverage of the history of the National Geographic, called "The Future of Flying," a 32-page cover story commemorating the centennial observance of the Wright Brothers' flight. The coverage was deemed noteworthy enough that it has been incorporated into the archives of the Library of Congress. In the last two years, McNally has written two books, The Moment It Clicks, and The Hot Shoe Diaries, both of which cracked Amazon's top ten list of best sellers. His advertising and commercial clients include FedEx, Epson, Sony, Nikon, Land's End, General Electric, MetLife, Adidas, American Ballet Theater, and the Wildlife Conservation Society, among others.</p>
            <p>He's known internationally for his ability to produce technically and logistically complex assignments with expert use of color and light. As part of his teaching activities, he conducts numerous workshops around the world.</p>

            <p>From 1994 until 1998 Joe McNally was LIFE magazine's staff photographer, the first one in 23 years. His most well known series is the "Faces of Ground Zero — Portraits of the Heroes of September 11th", a collection of 246 giant Polaroid portraits shot in the Moby C Studio near Ground Zero in a three-week period shortly after 9/11. A large group of these life-size (9' x 4') photos were exhibited in seven cities in 2002, seen by almost a million people. The exhibit and the book, printed by LIFE, helped raise approximately $2 million for the 9/11-relief effort.</p>
            <p>McNally has contributed for the National Geographic magazine for 20 years. One of his photographic projects for the magazine was "The Future of Flying," a 32-page cover story, published in December 2003, commemorating the centennial observance of the Wright brothers' flight. This story was the first all digital shoot for the magazine. This issue was a National Magazine Award Finalist,[3] and one of the magazine’s most popular covers.</p>
            <p>He has shot cover stories for Sports Illustrated, Time, Newsweek, Geo, Fortune, New York, Business Week, LIFE and Men’s Journal, among others.
